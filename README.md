This repository contains the implementation of a graph neural network-based approach for EEG signal classification, specifically designed for Alzheimer's disease detection using the OpenNeuro dataset.

## Project Overview

This project explores neural‑network–based EEG classification for early detection of Alzheimer's disease, leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs), transformer models, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The pipeline combines time–frequency analysis, connectivity measures, and graph-based representations of brain activity.

## Setup

Install dependencies with the pinned requirements file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Dependencies
- **MNE-Python**: EEG data processing and analysis
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **EEGRAPH**: EEG to graph conversion
- **SciPy**: Signal processing utilities
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning utilities

## Usage

### Quickstart

- Option A — Kaggle (recommended if you already use Kaggle):
  - Create a Kaggle Notebook and attach the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yosftag/open-nuro-dataset
  - Upload or import the notebook you want to run (see Workflow below) and execute cells top-to-bottom.

- Option B — Local:
  - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
  - Launch Jupyter and open the target notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

### Workflow (recommended order)
1) Preprocess raw EEG with MNE:
  - `01_data_preprocessing/data_cleaning_mne.ipynb`
2) Extract features from cleaned data:
  - `02_feature_extraction/feature_extraction_main.ipynb`
3) Generate time–frequency representations (optional but useful):
  - `03_time_frequency_analysis/continuous_wavelet_transform.ipynb`
  - `03_time_frequency_analysis/spectrograms_analysis.ipynb`
4) Build EEG graphs for GNNs:
  - `04_graph_construction/eeg_graph_construction.ipynb`
5) Train models:
  - `05_model_training/main_training_loop.ipynb`
  - `05_model_training/transformer_training.ipynb`
  - `05_model_training/cwt_training.ipynb`
6) Evaluate:
  - `07_evaluation/model_testing.ipynb`

## Methodology

### Signal Processing Pipeline
1. **Preprocessing**: Raw EEG signals are cleaned and filtered
2. **Feature Extraction**: Multiple features extracted including:
   - Spectral power in different frequency bands
   - Connectivity measures between channels
   - Time-frequency representations
3. **Graph Construction**: EEG channels represented as nodes, connectivity as edges
4. **Classification**: Graph neural networks trained for binary classification

### Model Architectures
- **Graph Neural Networks**: For connectivity-based features
- **Transformers**: For sequential EEG data
- **CNNs**: For time-frequency representations (spectrograms, CWT)

The models are evaluated using:
- Classification accuracy
- Precision, recall, and F1-score
- ROC-AUC analysis
- Cross-validation performance
